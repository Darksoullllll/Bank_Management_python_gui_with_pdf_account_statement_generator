# Bank Management System

This is a simple banking application made with Python and tkinter. It allows users to create new accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view their account balance.

 Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can install the tkinter library by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install tkinter

sage

To run the application, simply run the `main.py` file. The application will open a window with two buttons: "NEW USER" and "EXISTING USER".

If you click the "NEW USER" button, the application will open a new window where you can create a new account. You will need to provide your name, account number, and initial deposit.

If you click the "EXISTING USER" button, the application will open a new window where you can log in to your existing account. You will need to provide your account number and password.

Once you are logged in, you will be able to view your account balance, deposit and withdraw money, and transfer money to other accounts.

## Code Explanation

The code for this application is relatively simple. The main file, `main.py`, imports the tkinter library and creates a new tkinter window. The window has two buttons: "NEW USER" and "EXISTING USER".

When the "NEW USER" button is clicked, the `new_user_create()` function is called. This function opens a new window where the user can create a new account. The user will need to provide their name, account number, and initial deposit.

When the "EXISTING USER" button is clicked, the `exisiting_user_create()` function is called. This function opens a new window where the user can log in to their existing account. The user will need to provide their account number and password.

Once the user is logged in, they will be able to view their account balance, deposit and withdraw money, and transfer money to other accounts.

## Conclusion

This is a simple banking application that can be used to learn how to create a tkinter application. The code is relatively simple and easy to understand, making it a good starting point for junior developers.
